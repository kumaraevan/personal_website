        <h1>Writing</h1>
        <p>In my main page, I've mentioned that I have three hobbies, but since writing is my favourite hobby, I am going to talk about writing instead.</p>
        <p>I've always loved writing. Back then my parents would buy me books to read. But instead of reading them, I would just write the content of the book into my notebook.</p>
        <p>By the time I was in high school, I've wrote plenty pieces. But until now, I never published any of those pieces, as those pieces serve as my personnal collection.</p>
